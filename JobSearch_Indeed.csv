We're looking for a talented test automation engineer to build out a testing framework for our computer vision services. You'll operate with autonomy while working in an engineering culture that fosters empowerment. Along the way you will learn about cutting edge machine learning, and over time your role on the team will evolve with your growing interests and skill set.
Once we reopen, this position will be onsite at our Palo Alto office, near the Stanford campus and Caltrain.
What you'll be doing
Develop automated tests for our product and services using frameworks like Mocha, Selenium, Jest
Work with our development team to test new features, converting initial manual efforts into new automated tests
Identify new automation best practices for our growing engineering team
Improve our continuous delivery pipeline, ensuring that we can roll out frequent, robust releases

You will think creatively and your suggestions about new features and ideas we'll be considered by other members of the team.
You'll be working with modern Javascript and Python testing frameworks and infrastructure.
You will learn a lot along the way, diving into new technologies and the world of computer vision both on your own and during frequent company tech talks.
What you'll bring to the table
You have experience testing large scale software products.
You are a self starter who can prioritize what to work on and build out a robust testing pipeline.
You have the creativity to always think of new ways to break things. You won't settle until until we've covered as many corner cases as possible.
You're comfortable writing a variety of tests: during a given week you might go from writing unit tests for a backend service to end-to-end functional browser tests.
You can show that you're smart, analytical, and a fast learner. Sometimes you'll work on things using unfamiliar languages or technologies, but you know you can handle that.
There aren't any strict requirements for your background, but you're technical. Maybe you have a CS (or similar) degree, or you're a bootcamp grad with a STEM background, or you might be self taught with a few years of industry experience.

Exago is a 15 year old, privately held, growing and financially stable software company operating in the very hot business intelligence and analytics space.

We believe that a user’s first impression with the application or feature will serve as the foundation for future experiences both positive or negative. By combining our own unique, individual perspective with a deep understanding of an application’s systems and use cases, diverse feedback on engineering processes, product design choices and code change implications can occur. We design, we develop and we review test systems, test strategies and product quality processes to protect the stability of the application from future product changes that could inhibit everyday users from the value we set out to provide.

Schedulicity started with an idea: to make online scheduling easy. We build calendar solutions for microbusinesses and pride ourselves on bringing great experiences to our users. We love our customers, and they love us back. Our solutions are used by thousands of businesses and consumers nationally, allowing our providers unlimited access to new clients, while empowering them to manage their business more efficiently.
Schedulicity Inc., the leading online scheduling platform for small service-based businesses, is looking for a full-time SDET to join our team.
The Role
As an SDET, you will join one of our agile teams within our product development department. Your team will consist of a product owner, engineers, UI/UX, a QA associate, and yourself all working together to design, implement, and produce top-notch quality features for our web application, iOS applications, and Android applications. You will be responsible for the end-to-end automation of test cases for all application platforms as well as assisting with the continuous advancement of our automation processes.
Responsibilities
Create and maintain automated UI test cases to provide full testing coverage – this includes automated tests for web and native (mobile) applications
Reduce the need for manual testing
Maintain testing repositories and feature branches as needed to coordinate with the release cycle and deployments
Report on automated test results
Review pull requests for the web and native (mobile) repositories
Grow and maintain thorough knowledge of the Schedulicity application

The Technology
Our Web app is an Angular application so our E2E automation framework utilizes Protractor, a Node.js program which runs on the Jasmine test framework. Protractor is a wrapper around WebDriverJS. All Web application tests are written in JavaScript.
Our iOS and Android applications are developed in their native languages, Swift and Java/Kotlin, respectively. However for the E2E automation of said native apps we use a Node.js solution to provide parity to our web application automation. We run our tests against the Appium server with the WebdriverIO test framework. All iOS and Android tests are written in JavaScript.
Having experience or knowledge in the following is a plus:
Experience with Web Single Page Applications
Native application experience (iOS and/or Android)
Experience with Protractor, Appium, Selenium or similar technologies
Proficient in JavaScript or similar languages that transfer easily

We work effectively in distributed teams—using Slack, Zoom, and Google Meet to collaborate across the globe.
Our teams practice Agile methodologies—either using Scrum or Kanban as best fits the team. Work is scoped, tracked, and refined using Jira by Atlassian.
We use Azure as our web code repository and BitBucket as our native code repository and require all code to be peer reviewed before a pull request is approved.

Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. We’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and people – clearly confirming our industry leadership and our special culture driving it. We also offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.
About the Role
We’re building a welcoming & flexible team that prizes collaboration over competition, one which provides opportunities to learn new skills, mentor junior developers and contribute to the direction of both the team & the products we’re responsible for. This is a high trust environment where we allow team members to manage their own time, take holidays as they need it, and reward them with competitive salaries and equity.
The candidate will join our Cloud Workload Protection (CWPP) which is a brand new and a key product area for CrowdStrike.

As we support only evergreen browsers, we can push the boundaries of what’s possible on the web as a platform, on top of a system that strips any hyperbole from the term “big data”.

Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. We’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and people – clearly confirming our industry leadership and our special culture driving it. We also offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.
About the Role
We’re building a welcoming & flexible team that prizes collaboration over competition, one which provides opportunities to learn new skills, mentor junior developers and contribute to the direction of both the team & the products we’re responsible for. This is a high trust environment where we allow team members to manage their own time, take holidays as they need it, and reward them with competitive salaries and equity.
The candidate will join our Cloud Workload Protection (CWPP) which is a brand new and a key product area for CrowdStrike. We’re extending CrowdStrike’s mission of “stopping breaches” into the public cloud and cloud-native workloads.

This offering will help with defending against potential adversary activities involving cloud-native resources. When coupled with Falcon, CrowdStrike’s CWPP offering will provide a more comprehensive perspective on how the adversary is targeting key customer infrastructure. Our ultimate goal is to provide a single platform for securing the entire lifecycle of cloud workloads.
Our stack is Ember, but if you’ve used frameworks like React or Angular, you’re the kind of person we’re looking for and we’ll help get you up to speed. As we support only evergreen browsers, we can push the boundaries of what’s possible on the web as a platform, on top of a system that strips any hyperbole from the term “big data”. In close collaboration with analysts & clients, you’ll get to see the apps & visualizations you’re building used every day to hunt for hackers and protect systems.
What You’ll Need
A desire to collaborate closely with users, designers, & testers to deliver quality software that solves problems.
A deep understanding of Javascript and considerable experience building thick-client applications with modern frameworks such as Ember, AngularJS, Backbone, or React/Flux.
Experience with testing frameworks, tools, and methodologies such as QUnit, Mocha & Selenium.
Functional knowledge & interest in developing genuinely accessible interfaces.
Strong HTML & CSS skills, with bonus points for experience with animation, knowledge of approaches to scalable/modular CSS, & preprocessors such as SCSS & LESS.
Familiarity with client-side build processes & tools - Grunt, Gulp, Ember CLI, etc.
Comfortable with Git/version control workflows.
Bonus Points Awarded For:
Experience creating or contributing to open-source projects.
Experience with graphics & visualization tools such as D3 or ThreeJS.
Interest & experience with design & data visualization.
Experience with coaxing that last frame-per-second out of browsers.
Experience with cross functional collaboration with designers, developers and product owners

Work on things that matter
Ad Hoc is a digital services company that helps the federal government better serve people. Our teams use modern, agile methods to design and engineer government systems that connect Veterans with services, bring affordable health care to millions of people, and support important programs like Head Start. And as we work to make critical government services intuitive, accessible and human-centered, we're also changing how the government thinks about and uses technology. If you thrive on change, want to help close the gap between consumer expectations and government services, and can see the possibilities in ambiguity, then we want you here with us.
What matters most
Ad Hoc lives, acts and behaves according to our commitment to inclusivity, acceptance, accountability, and humility. We aren't heroes. We believe in missions larger than our individual selves and leave our egos at the door, learn from our mistakes, and iterate in order to better serve the people in our country. We prioritize building teams that represent the diversity of the people our government serves. We love the challenge of government-size projects. We want to bring modern skills to our partner agencies, help them better meet the needs of their users, and close the gap between consumer expectations and government.
Built for a remote life
Ad Hoc is remote-first and remote-always. We've designed our culture, communications, and tools to support a nationwide distributed team since the beginning. Being remote by design allows Ad Hoc to be thoughtful and intentional about creating diverse teams and supporting them with a work environment that fits their lives. With a generous PTO policy and Slack channels for every interest (from bird watching to space nerds to parenting) our culture embraces the things happening in your life. Maybe you need to adjust your schedule to care for a family member or take a bike ride. At Ad Hoc, that's embraced.
What you'll do
As an Ad Hoc QA Engineer, you'll be part of a cross-functional team, working closely with stakeholders, product managers, designers, and other engineers. We're looking for a driven and organized engineer to help our teams deliver the very best digital services for the public.
Our ideal QA Engineer knows how to test both frontend and backend code to ensure it is performant and meets business needs. They'll need to be able to understand requirements, specifications, and design documents, and they'll need to be able to create detailed test plans and test cases. They'll need to be able to develop and apply testing processes to both new and legacy codebases.
As an Ad Hoc QA Engineer, you'll be:
Shipping software that impacts the lives of millions of people.
Using modern testing languages and frameworks to build automated tests that can be integrated into CI/CD deployment pipelines.
Reviewing requirements, specifications, and technical design documents to establish traceability and provide feedback.
Creating detailed and well-structured test plans and test cases.
Performing thorough regression testing.
Testing APIs that support both the digital services we deliver as well as third-party usage
Create unit and integration tests to ensure systems meet business needs and perform as expected.
Helping us continuously, iteratively improve.
What we hope you'll bring
A minimum of two years of experience testing in major open-source languages and frameworks such as: React, Angular, Vue.js, JavaScript, Typescript, Java, PHP, Ruby, and Go.
A deep understanding of the fundamental technologies of the front-end: HTML, CSS, that sort of thing.
Experience developing public-facing web applications and services.
A solid understanding of accessibility requirements, especially Section 508 and WCAG.
Experience using automated testing frameworks and languages such as Selenium, Puppeteer, SonarQube.
Building automated tests for cloud environments and automated deployment pipelines, such as AWS or Azure.
Familiarity with mocking data or scrubbing for PII is helpful, too.
Solid spelling, grammar, and communication skills.
A commitment to agility, flexibility, and iteration.
More than that, our ideal candidate wants to contribute to work that is bigger than themselves, and wants to make a difference collaborating with their team. They care deeply about building better products, better relationships, and better trust in each interaction people have with their government. They believe in intuitive, easy-to-use government services. They collaborate well with designers, stakeholders, and other teams. They mentor and guide more junior engineers. They're human-centered.
And if you don't check every box on the list? That doesn't mean you can't help us in our mission to deliver critical government services. Talk to us!

About Us
Frank has a radical vision and a big goal: to make quality education affordable to all by fundamentally shifting the relationship between students and their finances. We believe that higher education should empower students, not hinder them. That’s why every student’s education should be affordable – no matter what language they speak, where they grew up, or how much money they or their parents make.
Our idea was born when we, like millions of students in the US, had to invest in our education. Information, assistance, and money for college were hard to come by. We learned that what should be the proudest moment in a student’s life quickly turns frustrating, confusing, and overly complicated, setting into motion a series of crucial financial decisions that all too often burden Americans for the rest of their lives. Our goal is to change that system and help students better invest in their own future.
Benefits
Impact. Join a vibrant, fast-growing, meritocratic company with no institutional barriers to professional growth
Benefits. Frank offers full-coverage of medical, as well as dental and vision benefits, and 401k

Work on things that matter
Ad Hoc is a digital services company that helps the federal government better serve people. Our teams use modern, agile methods to design and engineer government systems that connect Veterans with services, bring affordable health care to millions of people, and support important programs like Head Start. And as we work to make critical government services intuitive, accessible and human-centered, we're also changing how the government thinks about and uses technology. If you thrive on change, want to help close the gap between consumer expectations and government services, and can see the possibilities in ambiguity, then we want you here with us.
What matters most
Ad Hoc lives, acts and behaves according to our commitment to inclusivity, acceptance, accountability, and humility. We aren't heroes. We believe in missions larger than our individual selves and leave our egos at the door, learn from our mistakes, and iterate in order to better serve the people in our country. We prioritize building teams that represent the diversity of the people our government serves. We love the challenge of government-size projects. We want to bring modern skills to our partner agencies, help them better meet the needs of their users, and close the gap between consumer expectations and government.
Built for a remote life
Ad Hoc is remote-first and remote-always. We've designed our culture, communications, and tools to support a nationwide distributed team since the beginning. Being remote by design allows Ad Hoc to be thoughtful and intentional about creating diverse teams and supporting them with a work environment that fits their lives. With a generous PTO policy and Slack channels for every interest (from bird watching to space nerds to parenting) our culture embraces the things happening in your life. Maybe you need to adjust your schedule to care for a family member or take a bike ride. At Ad Hoc, that's embraced.
What you'll do
As an Ad Hoc QA Engineer, you'll be part of a cross-functional team, working closely with stakeholders, product managers, designers, and other engineers. We're looking for a driven and organized engineer to help our teams deliver the very best digital services for the public.
Our ideal QA Engineer knows how to test both frontend and backend code to ensure it is performant and meets business needs. They'll need to be able to understand requirements, specifications, and design documents, and they'll need to be able to create detailed test plans and test cases. They'll need to be able to develop and apply testing processes to both new and legacy codebases.
As an Ad Hoc QA Engineer, you'll be:
Shipping software that impacts the lives of millions of people.
Using modern testing languages and frameworks to build automated tests that can be integrated into CI/CD deployment pipelines.
Reviewing requirements, specifications, and technical design documents to establish traceability and provide feedback.
Creating detailed and well-structured test plans and test cases.
Performing thorough regression testing.
Testing APIs that support both the digital services we deliver as well as third-party usage
Create unit and integration tests to ensure systems meet business needs and perform as expected.
Helping us continuously, iteratively improve.
What we hope you'll bring
A minimum of two years of experience testing in major open-source languages and frameworks such as: React, Angular, Vue.js, JavaScript, Typescript, Java, PHP, Ruby, and Go.
A deep understanding of the fundamental technologies of the front-end: HTML, CSS, that sort of thing.
Experience developing public-facing web applications and services.
A solid understanding of accessibility requirements, especially Section 508 and WCAG.
Experience using automated testing frameworks and languages such as Selenium, Puppeteer, SonarQube.
Building automated tests for cloud environments and automated deployment pipelines, such as AWS or Azure.
Familiarity with mocking data or scrubbing for PII is helpful, too.
Solid spelling, grammar, and communication skills.
A commitment to agility, flexibility, and iteration.
More than that, our ideal candidate wants to contribute to work that is bigger than themselves, and wants to make a difference collaborating with their team. They care deeply about building better products, better relationships, and better trust in each interaction people have with their government. They believe in intuitive, easy-to-use government services. They collaborate well with designers, stakeholders, and other teams. They mentor and guide more junior engineers. They're human-centered.
And if you don't check every box on the list? That doesn't mean you can't help us in our mission to deliver critical government services. Talk to us!

Remote Software QA Developer,Sonar Software,"Milwaukee, WI 53201 (Kilbourn Town area)•Remote","We are hiring a Remote Software QA Developer. Sonar is an enterprise, B2B SaaS product targeted towards ISPs. It provides numerous features for ISPs such as billing, ticketing, network monitoring, inventory management, scheduling, service provisioning, and more.

We are looking to add at least one more person to the QA team. Here's what's cool about working in engineering at Sonar:

We are fully remote - We don't have an office anywhere!
Interesting technology - We have a GraphQL API, full CI/CD setup, Kubernetes deployment in Azure, plenty of interesting stuff on the backend (PHP, Laravel, Postgres, ElasticSearch, Snowflake, Redis, Swoole, etc.)
Modern frontend using Typescript/VueJS, Apollo, Vue, Sass, Webpack, and lots of cool commercial libraries, custom code, and complex challenges
Constant challenges - So it’s mostly helping us solve the interesting problems and making sure we don’t need to solve them again and again in the future.
Great team/culture - Flexible working hours and 40 hour weeks are what we do, we aggressively hire (and fire) to maintain a good, healthy culture, and we really care about our employees. Full benefits are provided, along with a stipend for home office equipment that you can spend on almost anything you want. We have a book-sharing club, we pay for conferences, and it's just generally a chill, fun place to work.
We are engaged in all kinds of great outside projects - For example, we're a partner in Microsoft Airband, which is bringing Internet access to millions of unserved people around the world.

Specifically, when it comes to testing, these are the things that you will have a chance to help contribute to/work towards bringing to life:

Define how testing will operate within engineering and set test strategies for feature development.
Test automation to support feature deployment to the real world.
Work closely with developers on testing strategy and how quality software will get produced.
Develop a culture of continuous learning and experimentation.
Use test tooling that will ensure that testing is easy to do for anyone on the team.

Here's what we need (don’t worry about checking off everything, we are looking for a solid mix of skills):

Someone in this role needs to understand the difference between functional testing (does the stuff work by itself), system testing (do things work when combined), and exploratory testing (rapid test design, development, and execution to discover information about the software you are looking at). We are doing a lot with Sonar, and being able to scale up your understanding and contribute quickly to product quality is our primary objective for you.
A mindset similar to a “software detective.” The codebase is large, there is lots of complexity, and you'll need a wide range of knowledge to learn, understand, and improve our product successfully. Being able to come in and educate yourself on how the software works and whom it serves is an essential part of this position. Extending this to the wider team process is also something you can expect to be part of your week since continual improvement is what we try to focus on. Being able to utilize the scientific method to create hypotheses and experiment with the software is what we are looking for.
Someone who is extremely self-motivated. You will face many details and need to foresee problem areas that others do not and help prevent issues before they can get to production. We tend to err on the side of leaving people alone to get work done, and since we're fully remote, that means you need to be really motivated and capable of working by yourself. For some people, this is pretty tough.
Someone who has a breadth of experience with QA / software testing techniques and tools. You should work with the development team to design, develop, and execute automation scripts using various tools (for example, Cypress, Postman, etc.). You should have a clear understanding of where QA happens and the tools at your disposal to help automate testing tasks. We are always building challenging stuff, and we have significant complexity in our web, mobile, and database platforms.
You should be familiar with the Agile/Scrum process or any good modern agile methodology. We are looking for someone to reinforce the bugs backlog priority and champion fixes. In addition, you should have experience with project plans detailing the expected level of effort and time required and consistently meeting the allocated milestones. We are moving towards a continuous delivery development workflow, and knowing/explaining how testing will fit into this is important for our testers to know.

Here are the hard requirements - we delete applications that ignore these:

No agencies/contract work/etc. - We're looking for individual, full-time employees
Only hiring in Canada & USA - No exceptions.
Please make it clear in your cover letter that you meet the technical requirements listed - We get a ton of applications, and many of them are people who really aren't qualified. Help us help you - call out that you've read what I'm looking for and speak to how you are a good fit",Full-time,https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=4c7a73d2df393bcb,"We are hiring a Remote Software QA Developer.

Sr. UI Engineer (Remote),Crowdstrike,"Houston, TX 77007 (Rice Military area)•Remote","At CrowdStrike we’re on a mission - to stop breaches. Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. We’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and people – clearly confirming our industry leadership and our special culture driving it. We also offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.
About the Role
We’re building a welcoming & flexible team that prizes collaboration over competition, one which provides opportunities to learn new skills, mentor junior developers and contribute to the direction of both the team & the products we’re responsible for. This is a high trust environment where we allow team members to manage their own time, take holidays as they need it and reward them with competitive salaries and equity.
Our stack is Ember, but if you’ve used frameworks like React or Angular you’re the kind of person we’re looking for and we’ll help get you up to speed. As we support only evergreen browsers we can push the boundaries of what’s possible on the web as a platform, on top of a system that strips any hyperbole from the term “big data”. In close collaboration with analysts & clients you’ll get to see the apps & visualizations you’re building used every day to hunt for hackers and protect systems.
Our ideal candidates are sensitive to the needs of the users of their software & love learning more about their tools every day. Get excited about new features in Chrome Devtools? Tested your work in screen readers? Ever lost half an hour getting an animation’s bezier curve to be just the right kind of bouncy? Looking for a challenge that’s out of the ordinary? Get in touch.
The candidate will join our IT & Security Operations team to work on Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM).
CSPM is a new and complementary product area for CrowdStrike. We’re extending CrowdStrike’s mission of “stopping breaches” into the public cloud control plane and native cloud resources. CrowdStrike’s CSPM offering will give customers visibility into both the (mis)configuration and compliance of native cloud resources, and potential adversary activity involving those resources. When coupled with Falcon, CrowdStrike’s endpoint security offering, our CSPM offering will provide a more comprehensive perspective on how the adversary is targeting key customer infrastructure.
What You’ll Need
A desire to collaborate closely with users, designers, & testers to deliver quality software that solves problems.
A deep understanding of Javascript and considerable experience building thick-client applications with modern frameworks such as Ember, AngularJS, Backbone or React/Flux.
Experience with testing frameworks, tools and methodologies such as QUnit, Mocha & Selenium.
Functional knowledge & interest in developing genuinely accessible interfaces.
Strong HTML & CSS skills, with bonus points for experience with animation, knowledge of approaches to scalable/modular CSS, & preprocessors such as SCSS & LESS.
Familiarity with client-side build processes & tools - Grunt, Gulp, Ember CLI etc
Comfortable with Git/version control workflows.
Bonus Points Awarded For:
Experience creating or contributing to open source projects.
Experience with graphics & visualization tools such as D3 or ThreeJS.
Interest & experience with design & data visualization.
Experience with coaxing that last frame-per-second out of browsers.
